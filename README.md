# IgboNLP

This project aims to develop NLP resources to support NLP-based research in Igbo. It is a low-resourced African language spoken majorly in the eastern part of Nigeria by the Igbo people ( about 45 million speakers and is made up of over 20 dialects).


# IgboTaggedCorpus

It is a folder in IgboNLP repo that contains 10 different files of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagged Igbo corpus. There are different genres of the corpus, viz; novel, religion, story, news, poem and essay. 

The files that start with fiction is a corpus from a novel, ITC is a religious corpus, story, news, poem and essay. 

They are POS annotated in three categories:
CoarseTagged.corpus: Coarse-grained with common grammatical tags.
finegrained.corpus: Fine-grained granularity with tags extended from CoarseTagged.corpus.
stripXS.corpus: Coarse by collapsing _XS tags from finegrained.corpus.
