# IgboPOS
The starting point for this project is the development of a new part-of-speech tagging scheme based on the EAGLES tagset guidelines, adapted to incorporate additional language internal features. 
This presents POS tagging experiments conducted using an Igbo corpus as a test bed for identifying the POS taggers and the Machine Learning (ML) methods that can achieve a good performance with the small dataset available for the language.
